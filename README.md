# Messenger
This is a full-featured Telegram clone, an online messaging application that I developed. Users can create chats, modify their appearance, add friends by email, search for existing contacts, and connect with people in real time. The app also includes functionality for managing chats and messages, such as copying, deleting, and forwarding them. To ensure security, I implemented token authentication with PyJWT, Google OAuth2, and email verification. I used Flask and JavaScript for the backend, MongoDB for chats, SQLAlchemy for users, Redis for temporal data storage, and CSS to create a visually appealing style. Initially, this project was intended for skill practice, but it quickly evolved into a substantial undertaking. Dozens of different technologies, 6.500+ lines of code, and a wealth of knowledge gained make this a significant accomplishment in my development journey!
