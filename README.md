# Messenger
This a Telegram clone (online Messenger Application). You are able to create chats, modify their view, add your friends by email and search for existing ones, connect with people in real time. There are also functionality to manage chats and your messages by copying, deleting and forwarding them. Lastly, token authentication, OAuth2 with google and email verification are implemented. I used Flask and JavaScript, MongoDB for chats and SQLAlchemy for users, Redis for temporal data and CSS to add a beautiful style.
Firstly my intentions were just to practice my skills. But later it became a huge project.
Dozens of different technologies, 6500+ lines of code and a bunch of learned stuff.
